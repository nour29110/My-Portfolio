# My 3D Portfolio Website  

This project is a **3D Portfolio Website** built using **React Three Fiber**, showcasing interactive 3D models, animations, and responsive design.

## 3D Model Creation with Blender  
The 3D model featured in this project was designed and animated using **Blender**, an open-source 3D creation tool. After creating and optimizing the model, it was exported and integrated into the project using **React Three Fiber**. This integration allowed for smooth rendering and interactivity directly within the browser.
